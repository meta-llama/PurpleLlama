# Meta Llama Guard 3-1B

Llama Guard 3-1B is a model that provides input and output guardrails for LLM deployments, based on MLCommons policy.

# Download

Please see the [Llama CLI Reference](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references/llama_cli_reference/index.html) for downloading this model.

# Quick Start

Since Llama Guard 3 is a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 model (see our
[model card](MODEL_CARD.md) for more information), the same quick start steps
outlined in our
[README file](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/README.md) for
Llama3 apply here.

In addition to that, we added examples using Llama Guard 3 in the
[Llama recipes repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes).

You can also find instructions on how to run Llama Guard 1B-INT4 model in [Llama Guard ET model instructions](ET_INSTRUCTIONS.md).
