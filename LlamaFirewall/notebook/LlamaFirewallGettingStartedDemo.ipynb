    "### 1. Using the Configuration Helper (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to set up LlamaFirewall is to use the built-in configuration helper:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "llamafirewall configure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive tool will:\n",
    "1. Check if required models are available locally\n",
    "2. Help you download models from HuggingFace if they are not available\n",
    "3. Check if your environment has the required API key for certain scanners\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Manual Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to set up manually:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preload the Model: Download the model to your local cache directory, `~/.cache/huggingface`.\n",
    "2. Alternative Option: Make sure your HF account has been set up, and for any missing model, LlamaFirewall will automate the download. To verify your HF login, try:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   huggingface-cli whoami\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   If you are not logged in, then you can log in via:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   huggingface-cli login\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. If you plan to use prompt guard scanner in parallel, you will need to set the `export TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=true` environment variable.\n",
    "4. If you plan to use the alignment check scanner, you will need to set up the Together API key in your environment, by running: `export TOGETHER_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`."
