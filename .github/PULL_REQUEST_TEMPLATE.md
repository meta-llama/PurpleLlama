Action required: Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To help us merge PRs quickly, all contributors must sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You only need to sign once for all Meta open-source projects.

Please complete your CLA here: https://code.facebook.com/cla

After signing, the CLA check may take up to an hour to report back. If you have signed and this PR still shows the "Missing Contributor License Agreement" check, please wait (it may take up to an hour) or contact cla@meta.com.

If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, please ensure the corporate CLA is signed as needed.

If you cannot sign the CLA or have any questions, contact cla@meta.com.
