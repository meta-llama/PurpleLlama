  message: |
    Cryptographic algorithms provide many different modes of operation, only some of which provide
    message integrity. Without message integrity it could be possible for an adversary to attempt
    to tamper with the ciphertext which could lead to compromising the encryption key. This ciphermode is unsafe.
