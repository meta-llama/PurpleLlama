  message: |
    The `RegExp` constructor was called with a non-literal value. If an adversary were able to
    supply a malicious regex, they could cause a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
    against the application. In Node applications, this could cause the entire application to no
    longer
    be responsive to other users' requests.
