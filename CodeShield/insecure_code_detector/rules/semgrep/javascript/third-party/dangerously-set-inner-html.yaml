  message: |
    The application was found calling `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` which may lead to Cross Site
    Scripting (XSS). By default, React components will encode the data properly before rendering.
    Calling `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` disables this encoding and allows raw markup
    and JavaScript to be executed.
