It seems to \n run no slower than the old code.\n \n+A number of bugs in the refactored code were subsequently fixed during testing\n+before release, but after the code was made available in the repository. Many\n+of the bugs were discovered by fuzzing testing. These bugs were never in fully\n+released code, but are noted here for the record.\n+\n+  (a) If a pattern had fewer capturing parentheses than the ovector supplied in \n+      the match data block, a memory error (detectable by ASAN) occurred after\n+      a match, because the external block was being set from non-existent\n+      internal ovector fields. Fixes oss-fuzz issue 781.\n+\n 2. Hardened pcre2test so as to reduce the number of bugs reported by fuzzers:\n \n-   (a) Check for malloc failures when getting memory for the ovector (POSIX) or \n-       the match data block (non-POSIX). \n+  (a) Check for malloc failures when getting memory for the ovector (POSIX) or \n+      the match data block (non-POSIX). \n        \n 3.
