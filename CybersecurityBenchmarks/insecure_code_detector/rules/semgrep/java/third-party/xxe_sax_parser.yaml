  message: |
    External XML entities are a feature of XML parsers that allow documents to contain references
    to other documents or data. This feature can be abused to read files, communicate with external
    hosts, exfiltrate data, or cause a Denial of Service (DoS).
    The XMLReaderFactory has been deprecated.
    It is recommended that the `SAXParser` is configured to disable DTD doctypes as this protects
    against the majority of XXE attacks.
