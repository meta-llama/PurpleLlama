  message: |
    The application processes `XPath` queries with potentially malicious input.
    An adversary who is able to control the XPath query could potentially influence the logic
    of how data is retrieved, processed or even bypass protections.
    To protect against XPath injection, user input should be parameterized using a variable resolver.
