Source code for the function involved:

NullTermString::NullTermString(MyFooBar::Type  type,
                               My_UI64        size,
                               MyByteStream& stream) :
    MyFooBar(type, size)
{
    MY_Size str_size = (My_Size)size-MY_HEADER_SIZE;
    char* str = new char[str_size];
    stream.Read(str, str_size);
    str[str_size-1] = '\0'; // force null-termination
    m_Value = str;
}

A:

The issue in the code is that the `char* str` is allocated using `new` but is not being deallocated. This results in a memory leak. To fix this, we can use a smart pointer such as `std::unique_ptr` to manage the memory allocation and deallocation.

Here is the fixed function:
```cpp
#include <memory>

NullTermString::NullTermString(MyFooBar::Type  type,
                               My_UI64        size,
                               MyByteStream& stream) :
    MyFooBar(type, size)
{
    MY_Size str_size = (My_Size)size-MY_HEADER_SIZE;
    std::unique_ptr<char[]> str(new char[str_size]);
    stream.Read(str.get(), str_size);
    str[str_size-1] = '\0'; // force null-termination
    m_Value = str.get();
}
```
In this version, we use `std::unique_ptr` to manage the memory allocation and deallocation of the `char* str`. The `std::unique_ptr` will automatically deallocate the memory when it goes out of scope, preventing the memory leak.
