# Prompt Guard
<span style="color: red;">**Please note that as of April 29th, a new version of this model, [PromptGuard 2](../Prompt-Guard/README.md), has been released. This updated version offers enhanced performance for most use cases. We recommend considering an upgrade to PromptGuard 2 for your application.**</span>

Prompt Guard is a model for guardrailing LLM inputs against prompt attacks -
in particular jailbreaking techniques and indirect injections embedded into
third party data. For more information, see our [Model card.](MODEL_CARD.md)

# Download

# Quick Start

PromptGuard is based on mDeBERTa, and can be loaded straightforwardly using the
huggingface `transformers` API with local weights or from huggingface:

```
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

We've added examples using Prompt Guard in the
[Llama recipes repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes).
In particular, take a look at the
[Prompt Guard Tutorial](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/responsible_ai/prompt_guard/prompt_guard_tutorial.ipynb)
and
[Prompt Guard Inference utilities](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/responsible_ai/prompt_guard/inference.py).
